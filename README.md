# One-Shot Learning using Memory-Augmented Neural Networks in TensorFlow

## Introduction

We're going to use a Memory Augmented Neural Network in TensorFlow to perform one-shot learning on the omniglot dataset. That means we'll be able to classify images by their labels after training on just a few samples. 

## Materials

- Windows 10 Home
- Python 3.6
- Anaconda3 2020.07
- Visual Studio 2019 Community
- Omniglot dataset

## Procedure

- Run `python omniglot.py` in terminal to train the model.
